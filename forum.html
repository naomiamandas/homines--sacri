      In a small amount of time we've grown to be quite the community located globally. We keep out for each other, keep each other updated and share information. We're all different
      types of people, with different views, though in one thing we all come together which is the importance of fighting against the function creep- the increasing
      technology focused on our biometrics. Here we all unite and also keep each other updated on events and important data.
