    <i>“hide your face! don’t show your eyes! don’t speak! don’t walk! don’t smell! they’ll take it all!”</i> <br \><br \>
    In a world where governments hide their actions under the impression they will do the right thing,
    we as citizens answer to all requests of sharing our own privacy sensitive information about ourselves and our bodies without considering the consequences. The possibilities of our ever-growing technology within our societies is used as justification for these requests, to keep us “safe”. The coercion that arises has created a structure in which the panopticon has spread it’s roots throughout our world, from our safe spaces such as our homes throughout the public space. We are expected to share any data of ourselves, especially biometric data, unknowingly and knowingly and the lack of transparency makes it impossible for the regular citizen to know where this data travels and what it’s used for. We can’t reject the request as it makes us seem suspicious. We have long lost the rights over our own biometric data and show no restraint. The idea of homines sacri, originated from the Roman Empire, has become an ingredient existing in all humans walking this planet. Biometrics has turned any person with political rights and status to just a body. A body that can be used, copied and shared without consent for any purpose the establishment feels it to be fit for. And it’s happening <b> right now </b> before our own eyes.
    <br />
    We as a community will NOT accept the naive give-away of all the information that makes up our individual identity and take charge over our own database. We wear anti facial recognition make-up, masks, anything to make our face as un-scannable as possible. Within this transparent community we come together, share information, speak about our struggles, beliefs and help each other with new ways of hiding our data. There’s freedom of speech and freedom in anonymity. Hopefully this will be the start of something new, a wake up call for anyone that has not seen reality yet and judges us for who we are.
